# Flutter

This is a simple Flutter application that displays "Hello World!" on the screen with a custom background color.

## File: `main.dart`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
```
This line imports the `material.dart` package from the Flutter framework, which provides a set of pre-designed widgets and themes based on the Material Design guidelines.

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(
    const MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        backgroundColor: Color.fromARGB(255, 91, 23, 23),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Hello World!'),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```
This is the main function, which is the entry point of the Flutter application. It contains the following components:

### `runApp`

```dart
runApp(
  const MaterialApp(
    home: Scaffold(
      backgroundColor: Color.fromARGB(255, 91, 23, 23),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Hello World!'),
      ),
    ),
  ),
);
```
The `runApp` function takes a widget and makes it the root of the widget tree, rendering it on the screen. In this case, the root widget is a `MaterialApp`.

### `const MaterialApp`

```dart
const MaterialApp(
  home: Scaffold(
    backgroundColor: Color.fromARGB(255, 91, 23, 23),
    body: Center(
      child: Text('Hello World!'),
    ),
  ),
);
```
`MaterialApp` is a convenience widget that wraps several widgets commonly required for Material Design applications. It includes widgets for navigation, theming, and more. The `home` property defines the default route of the app, which is a `Scaffold` widget in this case.

### `Scaffold`

```dart
home: Scaffold(
  backgroundColor: Color.fromARGB(255, 91, 23, 23),
  body: Center(
    child: Text('Hello World!'),
  ),
),
```
`Scaffold` is a layout structure for the major Material Design components. It provides a default app bar, title, and a body property that holds the primary content of the screen. Here, it sets the `backgroundColor` to a custom color and places the main content in the `body` property.

### `Color.fromARGB`

```dart
backgroundColor: Color.fromARGB(255, 91, 23, 23),
```
This line sets the background color of the `Scaffold` using the `Color.fromARGB` constructor. The `fromARGB` method takes four parameters: alpha (opacity), red, green, and blue. Here, the color is a dark red with full opacity.

### `Center`

```dart
body: Center(
  child: Text('Hello World!'),
),
```
The `Center` widget centers its child widget within itself. In this case, it centers the `Text` widget.

### `Text`

```dart
child: Text('Hello World!'),
```
The `Text` widget displays a string of text with the content "Hello World!".

## Running the Application

To run this application, ensure you have Flutter installed and configured. Then, execute the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

This will compile and run the Flutter application, displaying the "Hello World!" text centered on a dark red background.
```
